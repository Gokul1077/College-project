    "ABOUT THIS PROJECT:\n",
    "\n",
    "Contact Management System  is created in Python. The data has a python script (index.py).\n",
    "In the course of building your program one of the first things that gets created is the contacts.txt file.\n",
    "If this file doesn’t exist though, as is the case when the program is run for the very first time, Python will stop \n",
    "execution of the program, and indicate that fact as an error.\n",
    "Speaking about the system, it consists of all the called for functions that include adding, viewing, removing and also     upgrading contact lists. \n",
    "While including the call of a person, he/she has to provide given name, address and contact information. \n",
    "\n",
    "PROGRAM SPECIFICATION:\n",
    "\n",
    "Program that has functions to:\n",
    "a. add an entry into a \"list of lists\" called contacts (add_contact function).\n",
    "b. write the contacts data to the \"contacts.txt\" data file before quitting the program.\n",
    "c. view all the information in contacts (view_all_contacts function).\n",
    "d. open the \"contacts.txt\" data file and place them into the contacts list (the initialize\n",
    "function)\n",
    "e. let the user to search for a name in contacts, and then prints out that person's information \n",
    "(find_contact function)\n",
    "f. let the user delete an entry (delete_contact function)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line of \"contacts.txt\" will contain the record for a single person, with data fields on that line \n",
    "separated by the delimiter \"\\t\" (Tab), as shown \n",
    "\n",
    "BACKGROUND\n",
    "One strategy for keeping track of data, even when a program isn’t running, is by storing it in a database, an\n",
    "external file. The simplest type of database is a “flat-file” database, in which information is stored as \n",
    "strings of text.\n",
    "In the example contacts.txt file shown below, each of the three lines is a “record” of one person, and \n",
    "each section of a line (separated by a “delimiter”, a tab in this case) stores a data “field”: names, email \n",
    "address, and phone number. The information in this text file will be loaded in to the program. \n",
    "when that program is run, and a menu system will run the contact information as \n",
    "the user desires."
