# Contact Book Python Project
Contact Management System  is created in Python. The data has a python script (index.py).
In the course of building your program one of the first things that gets created is the contacts.txt file.
If this file doesnâ€™t exist though, as is the case when the program is run for the very first time, Python will stop 
execution of the program, and indicate that fact as an error.
Speaking about the system, it consists of all the called for functions that include adding, viewing, removing and also     upgrading contact lists. 
While including the call of a person, he/she has to provide given name, address and contact information.
